# Torbusnet - Novel LIDAR segmentation and pose detection network

See (http://github.com/antorsae/tea) for main project.

`lidarnet.py` contains code for training both networks.

Segmentation network contains a novel approach to reduce dimensionality of LIDAR frames from `3d` to `nx1d` signals.

Pose detection network takes inspiration from [PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation](http://stanford.edu/~rqi/pointnet/)
